ring,"(R,+,\cdot)",a set equipped with two binary operations that generalise the notions of addition and multiplication
semigroup,"(S,\cdot)",a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies closure and associativity
quasigroup,"(Q, \star)",a set equipped with a binary operation that obeys the Latin square property
loop,"(Q, \star)","a set equipped with a binary operation that obeys the Latin square property and has an identity element, or a quasigroup with an identity element"
field,"(F,+,\cdot)","a set equipped with two binary operations, which is an abelian group under the addition (with 0 as additive identity), as well as the nonzero elements being an abelian group under the multiplication (with 1 as multiplicative identity), and the multiplication is distributive over the addition"

rational numbers,\mathbb{Q},"the set of all numbers which can be expressed as the quotient $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $p$ and $q$ are integers, and $q$ is non-zero."
vector space,V,a set that is closed under finite vector addition and scalar multiplication
topological space,"N, (X, \tau)","a set of points, along with a set of neighbourhoods for each point, satisfying a set of axioms relating points and neighbourhoods"

open interval,"(a,b)",an interval which does not include its limit points
closed interval,"[a,b]",an interval which includes its limit points
inner product space,-,"a vector space with an additional structure called an inner product, which associates each pair of vectors in the spaces with a scalar quantity (the inner product)"
complete space,-,"a metric space in which every Cauchy sequence of points in $M$ has a limit in $M$, or converges in $M$. A space is complete if there are no ""points missing"""
